# Creating an Admin Configuration Form
This Plug-in retrieves and shows a table of Jira Projects {Id, Name, and Category}
The table was supposed to be accessible via Jira Administration panel, but due to some unknown error, 
I had to show it elsewhere, you can find it in the Manage Apps tab in the page called "List of Projects"
